This endpoint allows the developer to submit residential property disposals that are not reported via the [Report and pay Capital Gains Tax on UK property service](https://www.tax.service.gov.uk/capital-gains-tax-uk-property/start/report-pay-capital-gains-tax-uk-property) for a given NINO and tax year. This endpoint can only be used for a completion date of 7th March or later (but not a date in the future) and a disposal date within the specified tax year.
